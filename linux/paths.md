# Paths

Paths are string representations of filesystem locations. They are made of directories, separated by a slash. From left to right the directories go from lower in the tree (closer to the root) to higher in the tree (toward the "leaves"). Since the filesystem is treelike, there are many possible values for path.


* Path segments are separated by forward slash on linux and mac / 
* Path segments are separated by back slash on windows \
* Dot . indicates the current directory
* Dotdot .. indicates one directory level higher
