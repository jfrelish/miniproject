# Branching

After adding your friends as collaborators, branching from the master branch is the best way for you or other collaborators to work in harmony without affecting the master branch unless you Merge your work into master. Branching off from the master branch avoids a merge conflict since the collaborators are not doing their work on the master branch  


**step 1:** Open Git and type the following command: cd your-repository-name


**step 2:** make sure to update the local repository with the command: git pull


**step 3:** To branch off from master type in git checkout -b <branch-name-goes-here>; this command will make a new branch and checkit out. At this point you should be on your newbranch.


**step 4:** You need to push these changes to the remote repository with the command git push origin <new-branch-name>
