# Checkout 

## What is Checkout? 

* In Git terms, a "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity.

* To achieve this, simply use '$ git checkout <branchName>

### Checking out branches 

* git checkout commands lets user navigate between the branches created by git branch. It  updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.

#### New Branches 

* Git checkout works hand in hand with git branch. You can create the branch and checkout the same branch within one line of command. Instead of creating a new  branch first and then checking out the branch, simply use the below command to create and checkout the branch.
