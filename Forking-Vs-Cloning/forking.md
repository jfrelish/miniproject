 ## Fork
 A fork is a special type of clone that remains hosted. In the same way dev branches insulate master from new, experimental, or unvetted code, so too do forks. 
 The idea of a fork doesn't exist in git command-line tools. It is an extra layer of indirection provided by a hosted solution like GitHub or BitBucket. Forks make use of pull requests, which are another feature of a hosted solution. Pull requests declare the intent of the incoming party to merge with a mainline branch. In response, other devs have the chance to comment on the work, and approve or reject the PR.
