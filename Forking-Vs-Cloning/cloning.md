# Clone

A clone is copy of a git repository. It can be located on a local development workstation, on a fileserver, or in the cloud.
A clone is made with the `git clone` command and keeps a linkage with the repository from which it was cloned, which is called the remote. 
The linkage allows developers to stay up -to-date with development happening on the remote. Branches can be pushed to or pulled from with `git push` and `git pull`.
